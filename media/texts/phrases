All by yourself, sittin' alone
I hope we're still friends, yeah, I hope you don't mind

Que absurda es la esperanza, tiene máscara de estafa,
más cualquiera que la porte notará en ella ventaja

Got a couple things I wanna share with you
I wanna grow with you

Xan' in the rain, now I'm always rowdy
Xan' in my brain, now I'm always cloudy

I keep coming back, 'cause I can't cope by myself
I keep running back, but you're so bad for my health
I keep coming back, 'cause I can't cope by myself anymore

I wrestle with myself and with my vices

It's all a bit of fun until somebody gets hurt
I'll take it with a pinch of salt, another lesson learned

But I don't need to know what's real or not no more
I don't need to know what's real or not no more

It's nothing you should worry yourself about

I've never been so tired and lately I don't feel quite right

Everybody on the late-night shift
Everybody on a drinking crisis
Ain't nobody wanna feel like this
